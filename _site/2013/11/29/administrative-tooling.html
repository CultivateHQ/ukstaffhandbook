          <h2>Administrative Tooling</h2>

<div class="post">
<p>As well as specific tooling for your job (eg development) there are a number of tools that you will need to use. These are all cloud-based; we do not expect you to use anything as 1999 as Excel.</p>

<h3>Google Apps</h3>

<p><a name="google_apps"></a></p>

<p>We use Google Apps for mail, calendar, documents, wiki, hangouts, and for other apps&#39; authentication/authorisation. Our domain is neo.com, and you will have been issued with a login on joining.</p>

<p>Use a secure password, and 2-factor authentication.</p>

<h3>Wiki</h3>

<p>The wiki is a Google Site. It is <a href="https://wiki.neo.com/">here</a>.</p>

<h3>T2</h3>

<p><a name="t2"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://t2allocation.neo.com/#/offices/edinburgh/projects">T2</a> is an internal tool used for staff-allocation, and utilisation tracking. Please ensure your allocations are correct and up-to-date, especially <a href="/2013/11/29/holidays.html">holidays</a>.</p>

<h3>FreeAgent</h3>

<p><a name="freeagent"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://edgecaseuk.freeagent.com/login">FreeAgent</a> is the online bookkeeping tool used by the UK company. You will be granted access to FreeAgent; if you do not have this then ask Paul Wilson or Jenny Wilson.</p>

<p>Most people will use FreeAgent to:</p>

<ul>
<li>View expenses</li>
<li>Access their payslips</li>
<li>Fill in timesheets, when they are on client projects</li>
</ul>

<h3>Passpack</h3>

<p>We use <a href="https://www.passpack.com">Passpack</a> to securely share passwords. Mike Doel has written a handy guide <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/neo.com/neo-wiki/accounts-subscriptions/passpack">on the wiki</a>.</p>

<h3>Dropbox</h3>

<p>Dropbox is also used to share documents. For now, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com">register</a> for a free personal account and add your preferred Dropbox email <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/neo.com/neo-wiki/accounts-subscriptions/preferred-dropbox-accounts">here</a>.</p>

<p>Use 2-factor authentication for Dropbox.</p>

<h3>Hipchat</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.hipchat.com">Hipchat</a> is used for group and individual chat. Normally you will be expected to be logged in, but you do not need to be in any rooms -  unless there are project specific rooms that you need to be present in for communciation with clients and/or remote colleages.</p>

<p>Everyone in the organsation is a Hipchat administrator; anything you say in a non-individual chat is potentially viewable by anyone.</p>

<h3>Github</h3>

<p>We are a technical organisation. Regardless of your role, you will probably eventually need a <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> account, for example to look at the history of this handbook.</p>

<ol>
<li>Register with <a href="https://github.com">Github</a>.</li>
<li>Ask a developer to make sure you are on the Neo Github team.</li>
</ol>
