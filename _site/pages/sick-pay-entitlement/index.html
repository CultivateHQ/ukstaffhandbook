          <h3>Company Sick Pay</h3>

<p>Employee entitlement to Company Sick Pay, if any, is detailed in the employee’s Statement of Particulars of Employment. </p>

<h3>Statutory Sick Pay</h3>

<p>Employees who are absent from work because of sickness will normally be entitled to receive Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) from the Company providing they meet the relevant criteria.</p>

<p>Once the criteria have been met, SSP is not normally payable for the first three days of sickness absence, unless the employee has been absent and in receipt of SSP within the previous eight weeks. Thereafter the Company will normally pay SSP at the statutory rate in force for a maximum of 28 weeks.</p>

<p>In order to qualify for SSP the employee must notify the Company on the first qualifying day, and submit a certificate of absence (please refer to the Absence policy for more information) as soon as practicable. The Company reserves the right to withhold payment of SSP where an employee fails to follow the correct procedure.</p>

<p>Certain employees are excluded from the SSP scheme, e.g., employees who earn below the lower earnings limit for National Insurance purposes.</p>

<p>The provisions relating to SSP are extremely complex. Employees who have any questions about it should approach their line manager.</p>
