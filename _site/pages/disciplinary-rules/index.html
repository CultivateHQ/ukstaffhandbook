    <h1>Disciplinary rules</h1>
  </header>

  <p>These Disciplinary Rules should be read in conjunction with our <a href="pages/disciplinary-procedure/">Disciplinary Procedure</a>. The aim of the Disciplinary Rules and Disciplinary Procedure is to set out the standards of conduct expected of all employees and to provide a framework within which managers can work with employee to maintain those standards and encourage improvement where necessary.</p>

<p>It is our policy to ensure that any disciplinary matter is dealt with fairly and in accordance with the Disciplinary Procedure.  If you are in any doubt as to your responsibilities or the standards of conduct expected you should speak to your line manager.</p>

<h3>Rules of conduct</h3>

<p>While working for us you should at all times maintain professional and responsible standards of conduct. In particular you should:</p>

<ul>
<li>observe the terms and conditions of your contract, particularly with regard to:

<ul>
<li>hours of work;</li>
<li>confidentiality;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>observe all our policies, procedures and regulations which are included in this Employee Handbook or notified to you from time to time by means of notice boards, e-mail, the intranet or otherwise;</li>
<li>take reasonable care in respect of the health and safety of colleagues and third parties and comply with our Health and Safety Policy;</li>
<li>comply with all reasonable instructions given by managers; and</li>
<li>act at all times in good faith and in the best interests of the company, its customers and employees.</li>
</ul>

<p>Failure to maintain satisfactory standards of conduct may result in action being taken under our Disciplinary Procedure.</p>

<h3>Misconduct</h3>

<h2>Gross misconduct</h2>
