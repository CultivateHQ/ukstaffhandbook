    <h1>Right to request flexible working</h1>
  </header>

  <h3>Eligibility</h3>

<p>In order to make a request for the statutory right to request flexible working an individual must:</p>

<ul>
<li>be an employee;</li>
<li>have worked for the Company continuously for a minimum of 26 weeks at the date the application is made; and</li>
<li>not have made another application to work flexibly under the right during the past 12 months</li>
</ul>

<p>and either:</p>

<ul>
<li>have a child of 16 years or younger, or a child under 18 years in the case of a disabled child; and</li>
<li>make the application no later than the day before the child concerned reaches the age of 17 years (or reaches the age of 18 years, in the case of a disabled child); and</li>
<li>have or expect to have responsibility for the child’s upbringing; and</li>
<li>be making the application to enable them to care for the child</li>
</ul>

<p>or:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>is, or expects to be, caring for a person in need of care who is either:</p>

<ul>
<li>married to, or the partner or civil partner of, the employee, or</li>
<li>a relative of the employee, or</li>
<li>living at the same address as the employee.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>A &quot;relative&quot; is defined as a mother, father, adopter, guardian, special guardian parent in law, step parent, son, step son, daughter, step daughter, brother, step brother, brother in law, sister, step sister, sister in law, uncle, aunt or grandparent and includes adoptive relationships and relationships of the full blood or half blood or in the case of an adopted person, such of those relationships as would exist but for the adoption.</p>

<h3>Scope of a Request</h3>

<p>Eligible employees are entitled to request:</p>

<ul>
<li>a change to the hours they work</li>
<li>a change to the times when they are required to work to work from home.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important for employees to recognise that their right to request a change in their contractual working patterns refers to a permanent change to their contracted terms.  Whilst every effort will be made to accommodate requests to revert to the original working pattern, this cannot be guaranteed in the first year of the change to the contract of employment.  A fresh application to revert to the original terms cannot be considered under the statutory scheme until 12 months have elapsed from the initial application.</p>

<p>The fresh application will be considered in accordance with the Company’s obligations in statute and in the light of the employment situation within the Company at the time.</p>

<h3>The Procedure</h3>

<p>Any requests for flexible working must be made by the employee in writing. The written request should set out the working patterns that the employee is requesting, outline the impact the requested change will have on the employee’s workplace and suggest how the change may be accommodated by the Company.</p>

<p>Within 28 days of receipt of the written request, the Company will arrange to meet with the employee in order to explore the desired work pattern in depth, and to discuss how best it might be accommodated. The Company will also consider other alternative working patterns should there be problems in accommodating the desired work pattern outlined in the employee’s application. The employee is entitled to bring a fellow employee as a companion to the meeting.</p>

<p>Within 14 days after the date of the meeting the Company will write to the employee to either agree to a new work pattern and a start date; or to provide business ground(s) as to why the application cannot be accepted and the reasons why the ground(s) applies in the circumstances.  In certain circumstances, this written notification by the Company may be delayed to allow further investigation to take place.</p>

<h3>Appeals</h3>

<p>An employee can appeal against the Company’s decision to refuse an application by giving written notice of the grounds of appeal within 14 days after the date on which notice of the decision is given.</p>

<p>The Company will hold a meeting with the employee to discuss the appeal within 14 days after the employee has given notice. The Company will notify the employee in writing of its decision on the appeal within 14 days after the date of the hearing. The employee may bring a fellow worker as a companion to the appeal hearing.</p>
