This handbook tells you about the things you need to know about working for Neo (the Company). Every employee will have access to a copy of the handbook and you are expected to become familiar with its contents. If there is any matter in this handbook that you do not understand you should ask your line manager for clarification.

This handbook is designed to help you understand the policies, general rules and operating standards that apply to the employees of the Company. It is intended as a statement of the Company's policies and procedures and, unless specifically indicated, does not form part of your contract of employment. Any dispute between you and the Company will be determined on the basis and content of your contract of employment.

This handbook is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) site. The source is held on Github [here](https://github.com/neo/ukstaffhandook). It will be reviewed regularly and updated. Updates will be made as pull requests to master. Pull requests may only be merged by a director of Neo Innovation Europe Ltd, although anyone can open a request.
