title: Conferences and training
---

We encourage conference attendance and appropriate training.

### Budget Guidelines

The budget for conference and training for an individual is, per 12 month period:

* GBP Â£1,350 for tickets, travel, and other [expenses](/pages/expenses-policy/)
* 5 days for conference attendance and travel (in work time)

The budget does not rollover, and there is no expectation of having to use the entire budget. On termination of employment, an employee is not entitled to compensation for un-taken conference and training budget.

### Approval

Like holiday time, conference (and training) is subject to approval. This may be subject to

* sufficient notice (at least 4 weeks)
* sufficient cover for the employee's activities being available during that period
* the relevance of the conference or training to Cultivate

### Exceptions

#### Business Development

Employees who have a significant Business Development role have a greater leeway in budgets for attending relevant events.

Company mandated training does not count towards the employee's budget.

#### Speaking

If an employee is chosen to speak at an event, that the company deems to be relevant to its interests, then the time and budget cost will not be deducted from the employee's allowance. This may still be subject to approval on timing and cost.

#### Other

If an employee can make a compelling case for attendance at an event but have already spent their budget, or the cost is larger than the budget, then it may be extended to cover that event.
