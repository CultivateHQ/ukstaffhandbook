## Submission

Expenses are submitted via [Expensify](httsp://expensify.com) reports. Each expense should include:

* Full image of a VAT receipt, if VATable. Non VATable expenses just need a receipt. There are various attributes that make a receipt a valid VAT receipt, detailed [here](https://www.gov.uk/vat-record-keeping/vat-invoices), but the main thing to look out for is a VAT number; if it has one then it's probably ok.
* A link to the appropriate category (eg Travel Meals, accommodation).
* All the other information that Expensify forces you to add.

Expenses must be submitted within 90 days of being occurred.

A more detailed description of the policy for submitting expenses is in the [Internal Wiki](https://github.com/CultivateHQ/internal-documentation/wiki/Expense-Submission-Policy).

We no longer need you to submit physical receipts.

## Payment

Typically expenses will be paid with salary at the end of the month. If this is a problem, particularly with large expenses, let us know.

## Travel and Subsistence Expenses

We need to take a lead from [HMRC](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/321897/490.pdf) on what is claimable. Basically, it's costs for being away from the office and home, but needs to be reasonable.

When expenses are reimbursable from a client, their policy will trump our policy. For example, many American companies will not reimburse alcoholic drinks with a meal.

### Acceptable forms of travel

Try and book early, if possible, as last minute travel is usually more expensive.

Flights should almost always be economy, unless a higher class is not significantly more expensive (eg < 20% increase in price over economy). We are willing to pay more for more convenient flights (eg into LCY over Luton when heading into Central London).

Train tickets for journeys less than about 90 minutes should be standard class, otherwise first class tickets are acceptable.

### Hotels

It's hard to define how much a hotel should cost, as it varies from city to city and season to season.

Book hotels that you expect to be comfortable, low-stress, and in which you will get a good night's sleep. Book places that can achieve this and be reasonably priced for the season and location.

Self-catering may also be a good option, especially if you are staying somewhere for a while.
