These Disciplinary Rules should be read in conjunction with our Disciplinary Procedure. The aim of the Disciplinary Rules and Disciplinary Procedure is to set out the standards of conduct expected of all employees and to provide a framework within which managers can work with employee to maintain those standards and encourage improvement where necessary.

It is our policy to ensure that any disciplinary matter is dealt with fairly and in accordance with the Disciplinary Procedure.  If you are in any doubt as to your responsibilities or the standards of conduct expected you should speak to your line manager.
