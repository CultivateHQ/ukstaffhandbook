title: Paternity Leave Policy

### About this policy

This policy outlines when an employee may be entitled to paternity leave and paternity pay, and sets out the arrangements for taking it. 

This policy does not form part of any employee's contract of employment and we may amend it at any time.

You may be entitled to time off to accompany your partner to antenatal appointments or to attend adoption appointments. For more information see the [Time Off For Antenatal Appointments Policy]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/time-off-for-antenatal-appointments-policy) or the [Time Off For Adoption Appointments Policy]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/time-off-for-adoption-appointments-policy).

In some cases you and your partner may be eligible to opt into the shared parental leave (SPL) scheme which gives you more flexibility to share the leave and pay available in the first year. This applies where the Expected Week of Childbirth (EWC) starts on or after 5 April 2015, or if a child is placed with you for adoption on or after that date. This does not affect your right to take two weeks' paternity leave around the time of birth or placement. For information about SPL, see our [Shared Parental Leave (Birth)]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/shared-parental-leave-birth-policy) and [Shared Parental Leave (Adoption)]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/shared-parental-leave-adoption-policy) Policies. 

### Entitlement to paternity leave

Paternity leave is available on the birth of a child if either:

1. you are the biological father and will have some responsibility for the child's upbringing; or
1. you are the spouse, civil partner or cohabiting partner of the biological mother and will have the main responsibility (with the mother) for the child's upbringing.

Paternity leave is available where a child is placed with you for adoption by an adoption agency. In such cases you may be entitled to take adoption leave instead (see our Adoption Policy). However, adoption leave may only be taken by one adoptive parent. Paternity leave is available to the other adoptive parent (of either sex).

### Taking paternity leave

Paternity leave is a period of one or two weeks' consecutive leave taken when a child is born or placed with you for adoption. You can start your leave on the date of birth or placement, or later, provided it is taken within eight weeks (56 days) of the birth or placement. (If the baby is premature the period ends eight weeks after the start of the Expected Week of Childbirth.)

To take paternity leave you must give us written notice by the end of the 15th week before the Expected Week of Childbirth (or no more than seven days after the adoption agency notified you of being matched with a child), or as soon as you reasonably can, stating:

1. the Expected Week of Childbirth;
1. whether you intend to take one week or two weeks' leave; and
1. when you would like your leave to start.

You can change the intended start date by giving us 28 days' notice or, if this is not possible, as much notice as you can.

### Paternity pay

Statutory paternity pay (SPP) is payable during paternity leave provided you have at least 26 weeks' continuous employment ending with the Qualifying Week (the 15th week before the Expected Week of Childbirth or the week in which the adoption agency notified you of a match) and your average earnings are not less than the lower earnings limit set by the government each tax year. The rate of SPP is set by the government each tax year. 

### During paternity leave

All the usual terms and conditions of your employment remain in force during paternity leave, except for the terms relating to pay.

Holiday entitlement will continue to accrue during paternity leave. If your paternity leave continues into the next holiday year, any remaining holiday that is not taken OR cannot reasonably be taken before your paternity leave can be carried over to the next holiday year and must be taken immediately before returning to work OR within three months of returning to work unless your manager agrees otherwise]. 

If you are a member of our pension scheme, we will make employer pension contributions during paternity leave, based on your normal salary, in accordance with the scheme rules. Any employee contributions you make will be based on the amount of any paternity pay you are receiving, unless you inform the Pensions Administrator that you wish to make up any shortfall.

### Company Paternity Pay

As an alternative to Statutory Paternity Pay, the company will pay the employee at their full salary for 10 days of any combination of Ordinary or Additional Paternity Leave.
