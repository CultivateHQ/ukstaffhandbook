title: Time Off for Antenatal Appointments
---

### About this policy

This policy outlines the statutory right to take time off to attend antenatal appointments.

This policy applies to employees and agency workers. It does not apply to self-employed contractors.

If you are an agency worker, the rights set out in this policy only apply to you once you have worked in the same role with us for at least 12 continuous weeks (which may include more than one assignment). For these purposes we will ignore any breaks due to holiday or other leave to which you are entitled, breaks due to workplace closure, breaks due to industrial action, breaks of up to 28 weeks in cases of sickness or jury service, and breaks of up to six weeks for any other reason. We will treat breaks due to pregnancy or childbirth up to 26 weeks after birth, and any statutory maternity, paternity or adoption leave, as time worked.

This policy does not form part of any employee's contract of employment and we may amend it at any time.

### Time off if you are pregnant

If you are pregnant you may take reasonable paid time off during working hours for antenatal appointments. This may include any relaxation or parenting classes that your doctor, midwife or health visitor has advised you to attend.

Please try to give us as much notice as possible of the appointment. We may ask you to provide the following, unless it is the first appointment:

1. a certificate from the doctor, midwife or health visitor stating that you are pregnant; and
1. an appointment card.

### Time off for accompanying a pregnant woman: eligibility

You may take time off to accompany a pregnant woman to an antenatal appointment if you have a "qualifying relationship" with the woman or the child. This means that either:

1. you are the baby's father;
1. you are the pregnant woman's spouse, civil partner or [cohabiting partner OR are living with her in an enduring family relationship and she is not your sister, mother, grandmother, aunt or niece]; [or]
1. she has undergone assisted conception and at that time you were her wife or civil partner or gave the required legal notices to be treated in law as the second female parent; or
1. you are one of the intended parents in a surrogacy arrangement and expect to obtain a parental order in respect of the child.

### Time off for accompanying a pregnant woman: how to book time off

Please give us as much notice of the appointment as possible. You must provide us with a signed statement providing the date and time of the appointment and confirming:

1. that you meet one of the eligibility criteria in paragraph 3;
1. that the purpose of the time off is to accompany the pregnant woman to an antenatal appointment; and
1. that the appointment has been made on the advice of a registered medical practitioner, registered midwife or registered nurse.

### Time off for accompanying a pregnant woman: amount of time off

You may take time off to accompany a pregnant woman to up to five  antenatal appointments in relation to each pregnancy.

You must not take more than a day off for each appointment, including travel and waiting time.

Further time off for antenatal appointments is in our absolute discretion.
