title: Administrative Tooling
---

As well as specific tooling for your job (eg development) there are a number of tools that you will need to use. These are all cloud-based; we do not expect you to use anything as 1999 as Excel.

### Google Apps

<a name="google_apps"></a>

We use Google Apps for mail, calendar, documents, wiki, hangouts, and for other apps' authentication/authorisation. Our domain is cultivatehq.com, and you will have been issued with a login on joining.

Use a secure password, and 2-factor authentication.


### Holiday Spreadsheet

<a name="holiday_spread"></a>

Right now we need to track and enter holiday(vacation) time on the [Holiday Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/a/merecomplexities.com/spreadsheets/d/1MP_5FXrwi4vuL2k0znnIic1s4FSPmLP2M88uNHGGBLg/edit?usp=sharing).

### FreeAgent
<a name="freeagent"></a>

[FreeAgent](https://edgecaseuk.freeagent.com/login) is our former tonline bookkeeping tool used by the UK company. You will be granted access to FreeAgent; if you do not have this then ask Paul Wilson or Jenny Wilson.

Currently we only use FreeAgent to fill in timesheets when on client projects.

### Expensify

We use [Expensify](https://www.expensify.com) to add and get expenses approved. There are mobile apps which make this easier.

### 1Password

We use [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) to securely share passwords, via a shared vault on Dropbox (see below). This is expensable.

### Dropbox

Dropbox is also used to share documents. For now, [register](https://www.dropbox.com) for a free personal account. If you need a professional account, ask and expense.

Use 2-factor authentication for Dropbox.

### Slack

[Slack](https://www.slack.com) is used for group and individual chat. Normally you will be expected to be logged in, but you do not need to be in any rooms -  unless there are project specific rooms that you need to be present in for communciation with clients and/or remote colleages.

### Github

We are a technical organisation. Regardless of your role, you will probably eventually need a [Github](https://github.com/) account, for example to look at the history of this handbook.

1. Register with [Github](https://github.com).
2. Ask a developer to make sure you are on the Cultivate Github team.
