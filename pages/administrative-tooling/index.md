As well as specific tooling for your job (eg development) there are a number of tools that you will need to use. These are all cloud-based; we do not expect you to use anything as 1999 as Excel.

### Google Apps

<a name="google_apps"></a>

We use Google Apps for mail, calendar, documents, wiki, hangouts, and for other apps' authentication/authorisation. Our domain is neo.com, and you will have been issued with a login on joining.

Use a secure password, and 2-factor authentication.

### Wiki

The wiki is a Google Site. It is [here](https://wiki.neo.com/).

### T2

<a name="t2"></a>

[T2](http://t2allocation.neo.com/#/offices/edinburgh/projects) is an internal tool used for staff-allocation, and utilisation tracking. Please ensure your allocations are correct and up-to-date, especially [holidays](/2013/11/29/holidays.html).

### FreeAgent
<a name="freeagent"></a>

[FreeAgent](https://edgecaseuk.freeagent.com/login) is the online bookkeeping tool used by the UK company. You will be granted access to FreeAgent; if you do not have this then ask Paul Wilson or Jenny Wilson.

Most people will use FreeAgent to:

* View expenses
* Access their payslips
* Fill in timesheets, when they are on client projects


### Passpack

We use [Passpack](https://www.passpack.com) to securely share passwords. Mike Doel has written a handy guide [on the wiki](https://sites.google.com/a/neo.com/neo-wiki/accounts-subscriptions/passpack).

### Dropbox

Dropbox is also used to share documents. For now, [register](https://www.dropbox.com) for a free personal account and add your preferred Dropbox email [here](https://sites.google.com/a/neo.com/neo-wiki/accounts-subscriptions/preferred-dropbox-accounts).

Use 2-factor authentication for Dropbox.

### Hipchat

[Hipchat](https://www.hipchat.com) is used for group and individual chat. Normally you will be expected to be logged in, but you do not need to be in any rooms -  unless there are project specific rooms that you need to be present in for communciation with clients and/or remote colleages.

Everyone in the organsation is a Hipchat administrator; anything you say in a non-individual chat is potentially viewable by anyone.

### Github

We are a technical organisation. Regardless of your role, you will probably eventually need a [Github](https://github.com/) account, for example to look at the history of this handbook.

1. Register with [Github](https://github.com).
2. Ask a developer to make sure you are on the Neo Github team.
