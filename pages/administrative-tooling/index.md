title: Administrative Tooling
---

As well as specific tooling for your job (eg development) there are a number of tools that you will need to use. These are all cloud-based; we do not expect you to use anything as 1999 as Excel.

### Google Apps

<a name="google_apps"></a>

We use Google Apps for mail, calendar, documents, wiki, hangouts, and for other apps' authentication/authorisation. Our domain is cultivatehq.com, and you will have been issued with a login on joining.

Use a secure password, and 2-factor authentication.


### Holiday Tracker

<a name="holiday_tracker"></a>

Holiday (aka vacation, paid-time-off) is tracked via our the holiday tracker's slack interface. DM "The Cultivar" (@the_cultivar) on Slack with `hols help` for more information.

### Expensify

<a name="expensify"></a>

We use [Expensify](https://www.expensify.com) to add and get expenses approved. There are mobile apps which make this easier.

### 1Password

<a name="1password"></a>

We use [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) to securely share passwords, via the 1Password Team. You will be granted access to this.

### Dropbox

<a name="dropbox"></a>

We use a business account for shared document, to which permenant staff are granted acess.

Use 2-factor authentication for Dropbox.

### Slack

<a name="slack"></a>

[Slack](https://www.slack.com) is used for group and individual chat. Normally you will be expected to be logged in, but you do not need to be in any rooms -  unless there are project specific rooms that you need to be present in for communciation with clients and/or remote colleages.

### Github

<a name="github"></a>

We are a technical organisation. Regardless of your role, you will probably eventually need a [Github](https://github.com/) account, for example to look at the history of this handbook.

1. Register with [Github](https://github.com).
2. Ask a developer to make sure you are on the Cultivate Github team.

### Timesheets

<a name="timesheets"></a>

Billable staff should update their timesheets daily on [Timesheets](https://timesheets-production.herokuapp.com).
