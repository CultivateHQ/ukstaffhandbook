As well as specific tooling for your job (eg development) there are a number of tools that you will need to use. These are all cloud-based; we do not expect you to use anything as 1999 as Excel.

### Google Apps

We use Google Apps for mail, calendar, documents, hangouts, and for other apps' authentication/authorisation. Our domain is neo.com, and you will have been issued with a login on joining.

Use a secure password, and 2-factor authentication.

### T2

[T2](https://t2.neo.com/offices/edinburgh) is an internal tool used for staff-allocation, and utilisation tracking. Please ensure your allocations are correct and up-to-date, especially [holidays](/2013/11/29/holidays.html).
